🌊 Beach Forecast App  

The Beach Forecast App is a simple tool designed to display beach-related weather and safety information. The app serves as a concept for how users could check beach conditions in the future.  

🌟 Features  
✔️ **Displays Beach Forecast Info** – Includes weather conditions, tide levels, and UV index.  
✔️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and clean design for easy navigation.  
✔️ **Concept for Future Live Updates** – Built with the intention of integrating real-time data.  

🛠️ Built With  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript – A lightweight and responsive interface.  
- Mock Data (for now) – Since real-time API access is restricted, the app uses placeholder data.  

⚠️ Limitations  
- No Real-Time Updates – The app does not currently fetch live beach conditions due to API restrictions.  
- Private API Keys Required – To access real-time weather and tide data, you would need **your own API keys** from weather services, which are not publicly available.  
- Not Fully Functional Yet – Without live data, the app currently serves as a prototype rather than a fully working product.  

📂 How to Use  
1. Open the app in your browser.  
2. View the placeholder beach data.  
3. (Future) Integrate real-time API keys for actual forecasts.  

🚀 Future Plans  
- Implement real-time API integration once a reliable and cost-effective data source is available.  
- Allow users to search for beaches and save favorites.  
- Improve mobile responsiveness for better usability.
